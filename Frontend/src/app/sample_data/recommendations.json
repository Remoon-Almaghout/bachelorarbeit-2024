                  "description": "Reference management software, citation management software, or bibliographic management software is software for scholars and authors to use for recording and utilising bibliographic citations (references) as well as managing project references either as a company or an individual. Once a citation has been recorded, it can be used time and again in generating bibliographies, such as lists of references in scholarly books, articles and essays. The development of reference management packages has been driven by the rapid expansion of scientific literature.\nThese software packages normally consist of a database in which full bibliographic references can be entered, plus a system for generating selective lists of articles in the different formats required by publishers and scholarly journals. Modern reference management packages can usually be integrated with word processors so that a reference list in the appropriate format is produced automatically as an article is written, reducing the risk that a cited source is not included in the reference list. They will also have a facility for importing the details of publications from bibliographic databases.\nReference management software does not do the same job as a bibliographic database, which tries to list all articles published in a particular discipline or group of disciplines. Such bibliographic databases are large and have to be housed on major server installations. Reference management software collects a much smaller database, of the publications that have been used or are likely to be used by a particular author or group, and such a database can easily be housed on an individual's personal computer.\nApart from managing references, most reference management software also enables users to search references from online libraries. These online libraries are usually based on Z39.50 public protocol. Users just need to specify the IP address, database name and keywords to start a Z39.50 search. It is quicker and more efficient than a web browser. However, Z39.50 is a little out of date. Some popular scientific websites, such as Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore and arXiv, do not support the Z39.50 protocol.",

                  "description": "Background Reference management software programs enable researchers to more easily organize and manage large volumes of references typically identified during the production of systematic reviews. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which authors are using reference management software to produce systematic reviews; identify which programs are used most frequently and rate their ease of use; and assess the degree to which software usage is documented in published studies. Methods We reviewed the full text of systematic reviews published in core clinical journals indexed in ACP Journal Club from 2008 to November 2011 to determine the extent to which reference management software usage is reported in published reviews. We surveyed corresponding authors to verify and supplement information in published reports, and gather frequency and ease-of-use data on individual reference management programs. Results Of the 78 researchers who responded to our survey, 79.5% reported that they had used a reference management software package to prepare their review. Of these, 4.8% reported this usage in their published studies. EndNote, Reference Manager, and RefWorks were the programs of choice for more than 98% of authors who used this software. Comments with respect to ease-of-use issues focused on the integration of this software with other programs and computer interfaces, and the sharing of reference databases among researchers. Conclusions Despite underreporting of use, reference management software is frequently adopted by authors of systematic reviews. The transparency, reproducibility and quality of systematic reviews may be enhanced through increased reporting of reference management software usage.",

                  "description": "A citation is a reference to a source. More precisely, a citation is an abbreviated alphanumeric expression embedded in the body of an intellectual work that denotes an entry in the bibliographic references section of the work for the purpose of acknowledging the relevance of the works of others to the topic of discussion at the spot where the citation appears.\nGenerally, the combination of both the in-body citation and the bibliographic entry constitutes what is commonly thought of as a citation (whereas bibliographic entries by themselves are not).\nCitations have several important purposes: to uphold intellectual honesty (or avoiding plagiarism), to attribute prior or unoriginal work and ideas to the correct sources, to allow the reader to determine independently whether the referenced material supports the author's argument in the claimed way, and to help the reader gauge the strength and validity of the material the author has used.The forms of citations generally subscribe to one of the generally accepted citations systems, such as the Oxford, Harvard, MLA, NLM, American Sociological Association (ASA), American Psychological Association (APA), and other citations systems, because their syntactic conventions are widely known and easily interpreted by readers. Each of these citation systems has its advantages and disadvantages. Editors often specify the citation system to use.\nBibliographies, and other list-like compilations of references, are generally not considered citations because they do not fulfill the true spirit of the term: deliberate acknowledgment by other authors of the priority of one's ideas.",

The unit must display such gallantry, determination, and esprit de corps in accomplishing its mission under extremely difficult and hazardous conditions so as to set it apart from and above other units participating in the same campaign.\nSince its inception by Executive Order on 26 February 1942, retroactive to 7 December 1941, to 2008, the Presidential Unit Citation has been awarded in conflicts such as World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, Iraq War, and the War in Afghanistan.\nThe collective degree of valor (combat heroism) against an armed enemy by the unit nominated for the PUC is the same as that which would warrant award of the individual award of the Distinguished Service Cross, Air Force Cross or Navy Cross. In some cases, one or more individuals within the unit may have also been awarded individual awards for their contribution to the actions for which their entire unit was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation.  The units with the most Presidential Unit Citations are submarine USS Parche (SSN-683) and the 1st Marine Division, both with 9 citations.",

Citation counts are interpreted as measures of the impact or influence of academic work and have given rise to the field of bibliometrics or scientometrics, specializing in the study of patterns of academic impact through citation analysis. The journal impact factor, the two-year average ratio of citations to articles published, is a measure of the importance of journals. It is used by academic institutions in decisions about academic tenure, promotion and hiring, and hence also used by authors in deciding which journal to publish in. Citation-like measures are also used in other fields that do ranking, such as Google's PageRank algorithm, software metrics, college and university rankings, and business performance indicators.",

A significant number of bibliographic databases are proprietary, available by licensing agreement from vendors, or directly from the indexing and abstracting services that create them.Many bibliographic databases have evolved into digital libraries, providing the full text of the indexed contents: for instance CORE also mirrors and indexes the full text of scholarly articles and Our Research develops a search engine for open access content found by Unpaywall. Others converge with non-bibliographic scholarly databases to create more complete disciplinary search engine systems, such as Chemical Abstracts or Entrez.",

Filename extension it is usually noted in parentheses if they differ from the file format name or abbreviation. Many operating systems do not limit filenames to one extension shorter than 4 characters, as was common with some operating systems that supported the File Allocation Table (FAT) file system.  Examples of operating systems that do not impose this limit include Unix-like systems, and Microsoft Windows NT, 95-98, and ME which have no three character limit on extensions for 32-bit or 64-bit applications on file systems other than pre-Windows 95 and Windows NT 3.5 versions of the FAT file system. Some filenames are given extensions longer than three characters. While MS-DOS and NT always treat the suffix after the last period in a file's name as its extension, in UNIX-like systems, the final period does not necessarily mean that the text after the last period is the file's extension.Some file formats, such as .txt or .text, may be listed multiple times.",

In contrast to open file formats, closed file formats are considered trade secrets. However, the actual image used by an open file format may still be copyrighted or trademarked.\nDepending on the definition, the specification of an open format may require a fee to access or, very rarely, contain other restrictions.

Released in beta in November 2004, the Google Scholar index includes most peer-reviewed online academic journals and books, conference papers, theses and dissertations, preprints, abstracts, technical reports, and other scholarly literature, including court opinions and patents. Google Scholar uses a web crawler, or web robot, to identify files for inclusion in the search results. For content to be indexed in Google Scholar, it must meet certain specified criteria. An earlier statistical estimate published in PLOS One using a Mark and recapture method estimated  approximately 80\u201390% coverage of all articles published in English with an estimate of 100 million. This estimate also determined how many documents were freely available on the internet.\nGoogle Scholar has been criticized for not vetting journals and for including predatory journals in its index.The University of Michigan Library and other libraries whose collections Google scanned for Google Books and Google Scholar retained copies of the scans and have used them to create the HathiTrust Digital Library.",

                  "description": "1914-1918-online. International Encyclopedia of the First World War is an international, English-language online encyclopedia of the First World War. Deemed the largest research network of its kind, it officially went online on 8 October 2014. The editorial office is staffed by historians and uses Semantic MediaWiki.\nThe Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin (FU Berlin) and the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek (Bavarian State Library) in Munich initiated the online academic reference work in the run-up to the centenary commemorations of the Great War. The project has since gained the support of several international partners, including the German Historical Institutes in London, Moscow, Paris, Rome, Warsaw as well as the Orient-Institut Istanbul (Oriental Institute in Istanbul). It has furthermore acquired eight-figure funds from the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research Foundation), funding which was extended in 2016 by an \u201cOpen Encyclopedia System\u201d follow-up grant. \nThe project leaders are Oliver Janz, professor of modern history at the Friedrich-Meinecke-Institut (FMI), Nicolas Apostolopoulos, director of the Center for Digital Systems (CeDiS), both at the Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin, and Gregor Horstkemper from the Zentrum f\u00fcr Elektronisches Publizieren - ZEP (Center for Electronic Publication) at the Bavarian State Library.1914-1918-online intends to provide the most recent global research on the First World War to the academic community and the public through a multi-perspective, open-access approach. Up to 1,000 experts from over fifty different countries will be working or have worked on this ongoing project. With a goal of approximately 1,500 entries, all content is published using the Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 3.0. The fully citable, Digital Object Identifier (DOI) equipped texts have been peer-reviewed (double blind) and enriched with images, maps and other related content. The encyclopedia is divided thematically and regionally, and all sections are easily accessible via search and navigation options (filter, register, timeline). Links and interfaces connect 1914-1918-online to other databases as well as information systems such as Europeana 1914-1918, CENDARI, WorldCat and Zotero.\nThe editorial board is composed of seven General Editors (Ute Daniel, Peter Gatrell, Oliver Janz, Heather Jones, Jennifer Keene, Alan Kramer and Bill Nasson), several Section Editors, and numerous external reviewers, a total of roughly 100 persons. The Editorial Advisory Board includes Annette Becker, J\u00fcrgen Danyel, Josef Ehmer, Gudrun Gersmann, Antonio Gibelli, Gerhard Hirschfeld, John Horne, J\u00fcrgen Kocka, Gerd Krumeich, J\u00fcrgen Osterhammel, Hew Strachan, Jay Winter and Erik-Jan Z\u00fcrcher.The project made the American Library Association's 2015 \u201cAnnual List of Best Historical Materials\u201d and received the second prize at the 2015 Berlin Digital Humanities Awards.",

After experiencing financial difficulties over a period of years, the university filed for creditor protection on February 1, 2021. The university subsequently announced the closure of 69 undergraduate and graduate programs as well as the termination of 194 full-time workers, including 116 full-time faculty positions, 41 unionized staff and 37 non-union jobs (24 of which were in management and executive positions). It also marked the first time in Canadian history that a public university sought recourse under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA).\nThe crisis has provoked sharp criticism of both the university administration and the Ontario provincial government as well as sparking discussion surrounding the state of postsecondary education in Canada, including the future of Indigenous and Franco-Ontarian education. Concerns have also been raised about the impact of the cuts on the cultural and economic life of northern Ontario, with some estimates predicting an economic cost of over $100 million to the city of Greater Sudbury.",

A significant number of bibliographic databases are proprietary, available by licensing agreement from vendors, or directly from the indexing and abstracting services that create them.Many bibliographic databases have evolved into digital libraries, providing the full text of the indexed contents: for instance CORE also mirrors and indexes the full text of scholarly articles and Our Research develops a search engine for open access content found by Unpaywall. Others converge with non-bibliographic scholarly databases to create more complete disciplinary search engine systems, such as Chemical Abstracts or Entrez.",

In mid-2019, Libraries Australia partnered with Trove, and as of June 2020 is set to be co-branded with Trove.\nANBD is Australia's largest single bibliographic resource, containing bibliographic records of published and unpublished sources that form part of an Australian collection, as well as catalogue records of items from the US Library of Congress and other institutions. It includes holdings data, name and subject authority records. It supplies records to Libraries Australia in various supported formats, in order to provide enriched data and support copy cataloguing, thus streamlining services for all libraries in Australia. It is a subscription-based service, via Libraries Australia, for librarians, used for reference, collection development, cataloguing and inter-library loans. It thus also serves as a kind of enhanced union catalogue.",

Databases and search engines differ substantially in terms of coverage and retrieval qualities. Users need to account for qualities and limitations of databases and search engines, especially those searching systematically for records such as in systematic reviews or meta-analyses. As the distinction between a database and a search engine is unclear for these complex document retrieval systems, see:\n\nthe general list of search engines for all-purpose search engines that can be used for academic purposes\nthe article about bibliographic databases for information about databases giving bibliographic information about finding books and journal articles.The terms \"free\", \"subscription\", and \"free & subscription\" will refer to the availability of the website as well as the journal articles used. Furthermore, some programs are only partly free (for example, accessing abstracts or a small number of items), whereas complete access is prohibited (login or institutional subscription required).\nThe \"Size\" column denotes the number of documents (articles, publications, datasets, preprints) rather than the number of citations or references. The database itself should be the primary source of statistics, and if it is not accessible, the independent estimates released as journal papers should be. Notably, Google Scholar does not offer such detail, but the database's size has been calculated.",
